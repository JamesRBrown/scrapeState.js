Title: Scrape State
Author: James R Brown
Date: 4.2.16

Scrape State is a utility to help scrape pages with PhantomJS.
The idea is to monitor events, and then execute the next function
when events stop coming in.  

Usage:
The user simply adds functions to Scrape Stage and then kicks off
the process with "start".

Setup:
Setup can be manually configured, or you can pass in your page obj
and Scrape State will initialize itself.
